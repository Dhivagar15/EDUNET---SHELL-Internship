This project serves as an introductory data science assignment focused on the initial stages of a Climate Risk and Disaster Management analysis.

The core objective was to perform preliminary data exploration on a relevant dataset. This involved:

Importing the necessary Python libraries, primarily pandas.

Loading the dataset into a DataFrame.

Utilizing standard pandas methods (.info(), .describe(), .isnull().sum()) to gain a foundational understanding of the data's structure, data types, and presence of missing values.

The final output is a completed Jupyter Notebook containing this code and its results, along with the dataset, submitted to a GitHub repository.
